# Bipin Chaudhary - Data Analyst Project

Hi, I'm Bipin!, a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Information Technology from Tribhuvan University. I'm passionate about leveraging data to extract meaningful insights and drive informed decision-making. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist.

During my studies, I got really good at handling tricky data and spotting patterns and trends. I also learned a lot about managing data, running tests in the lab, and analyzing statistics, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

This repository serves to showcase my skills, as a platform to share my projects, and as a way to track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science related topics.

# Certificates
I believe that the best way to showcase skills is by doing and sharing your job, but sometimes certificates appear to be an indirect result. So here is a list of the ones I have (in reverse-chronological order, with the date of completion in brackets):

* [Data Analytics Essentials](https://www.credly.com/badges/5cf01f7e-f68b-40b6-bd4f-80e4e3b2a22b/public_url) (Jan 2024) (Cisco Networking Academy)
