# Bipin Chaudhary - Data Analyst Project

Hi, I'm Bipin!, a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Information Technology from Tribhuvan University. I'm passionate about leveraging data to extract meaningful insights and drive informed decision-making. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist.

During my studies, I got really good at handling tricky data and spotting patterns and trends. I also learned a lot about managing data, running tests in the lab, and analyzing statistics, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

This repository serves to showcase my skills, as a platform to share my projects, and as a way to track my progress in Data Analytics and Data Science related topics.

# Portfolio Projects
In this section, I will list data analytics projects, briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

# Web Scraping of All-Time Favorite Romance Novels from Goodreads

**Code:** [Web Scraping of All-Time Favorite Romance Novels from Goodreads.ipynb](https://github.com/Bipin-11/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Web%20Scraping%20of%20All-Time%20Favorite%20Romance%20Novels%20from%20Goodreads.ipynb)

**Goal:** The goal of this project is to scrape data from the Goodreads website to gather information about all-time favorite romance novels. The data includes book titles, authors, average scores, ratings, and number of votes.

**Description:** The project revolves around extracting data from Goodreads' "All-Time Favorite Romance Novels" list through web scraping. The script systematically sends HTTP requests to each page of the list, retrieving book details including title, author, average score, rating, and number of votes. These details are then organized and stored within the respective lists for further analysis. The extraction process relies on the BeautifulSoup library, which facilitates the parsing of HTML content and the extraction of pertinent information from web pages. This approach enables the collection of comprehensive data from the specified source, aiding in insight generation and potential analysis.

**Skills:** Web Scraping, Data Extraction, Data Manipulation, Python Programming

**Technology:** Python, BeautifulSoup, Requests

**Results:** The project successfully scraped data from Goodreads' "All Time Favorite Romance Novels" list, extracting book titles, authors, average scores, ratings, and votes. This data is stored in lists for further analysis or exportation, offering insights into readers' preferences within the romance genre.

# Exploring eBay Car Sales Data

**Code:** [Exploring eBay Car Sales Data.ipynb](https://github.com/Bipin-11/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Exploring%20eBay%20Car%20Sales%20Data.ipynb)

**Goal:** The objective of this project is to analyze a dataset of used car listings from eBay Kleinanzeigen, the classifieds section of the German eBay website. The goal is to clean up the data and perform initial exploratory analysis to gain insights into various aspects of the used car market.

**Description:** This project entails exploring a dataset of used car listings from eBay Kleinanzeigen. The dataset contains attributes such as car make, model, price, odometer reading, registration year, and more. The primary tasks involve data cleaning, including handling missing values and correcting data types, followed by exploratory analysis to understand patterns and trends in the used car market.

**Skills:** Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis , Python Programming

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, NumPy

**Results:** The project successfully cleaned the dataset and performed exploratory analysis to uncover insights into the used car market on eBay Kleinanzeigen. Key findings include the distribution of car prices, the influence of mileage on prices, popular car brands, and more. These insights can inform decision-making processes for buyers, sellers, and market analysts within the used car industry.
